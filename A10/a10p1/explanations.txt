a.  When 'using namespace std;' is commented out the error displays
    "use of undeclared identifier" for cout, cin, endl.
    So without using the standard 'std' namespace the compiler cannot
    recognize the cout, cin, endl which falls under std namespace.
    Then, either every time cin, cout or endl is used it should be
    used like (std::cin, std::cout, std::endl). The proper solution 
    is just including the namespace so the std:: does not need to be
    written everytime a standard namespace component is used.

b.  Here seems to be a similar problem where the error is 
    "use of undeclared identifier" for name or hunger or for the objects
    that fall on the class of critter. In the Critter.h file it can be seen
    that (name and hunger) fall under the class "Critter".
    So if that class is not included in the function the compiler cannot
    recognize what name or hunger is used for.
